# coordinatesystem Library

The coordinatesystem library is a python library which
provides 2-dimensional coordinate system facility and control.

## Equivalent Coordinate Conversion
The library provides the functionality to convert one x-y
coordinate system to another scaled, rotated, or reflected x-y
coordinate system. This can be used in multiple applications
including the conversion of UTM coordinates to image coordinates.

## Basic Coordinate System Calculations
The library also provides basic calculations for coordinate system
components. Some of the functions that the library provides are:
* Slope Determination
* Point Rotation
* Point Conversion
* Line Angle Calculations
